My passion for aviation began many years ago when. The story goes that when I was born, I came flying out, and a new pilot was born. My wife said that would be an exciting way to start my first post. The real story is a bit less exciting. But either way, here we go!

My first memories of flying as a child are pretty sparse, I remember once flying on some sort of twin turboprop commuter plane. I don't remember anything other than the fact that it had propellers so I wouldn't even begin to speculate on what kind of aircraft it actually was.

It wasn't until when I entered sixth grade (at least that I can recall) that I became sort of obsessed with airplanes and how they flew. In school, my binder was covered completely by airliners of varying types and sizes. The fact that something so big and heavy could fly through the air simply amazed me.

Over the years my fascination grew and once I graduated from High School, I started taking some flying lessons at a local FBO with a great instructor. However, finances were tight and training was suspended after about 6 months of bi-weekly flights. It wasn't until 8 years later that I picked it back up and decided to make it my career.

I sought any position in the airline industry I could get. Having customer service experience, I applied for a Customer Service Agent position at a regional carrier, but instead was hired as a Ground Operations Agent. It wasn't exactly what I wanted to do, but it was a great learning experience and still got to work with lots of aircraft from MD-80's to A320's. I was also in the hiring process for the TSA that everyone seems to love to hate. But at last, I found what I want to do and made the plunge into the deep sea of student loans to make that a reality.

Thank you for making it this far through my first blog post. Hopefully you'll join me on my journey entering into the world of being a professional pilot. I'll be writing articles on important aviation news, incidents, and personal experiences. I guarantee it'll be worth your while.

Until next time!
