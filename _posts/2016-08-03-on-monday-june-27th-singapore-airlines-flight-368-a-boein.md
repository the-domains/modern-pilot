On Monday, June 27th, Singapore Airlines Flight 368, a Boeing 777-300ER with 222 passengers and 19 crew aboard, made an emergency landing at Changi airport in Singapore and burst into flames according to a statement made by the airline on Twitter.

The flight departed at 2:24am and about 2 hours into the flight, the crew noticed an "engine oil warning message", prompting a return. At 6:48am local time, the jetliner touched back down and came to a stop, just 4 hours and 24 minutes after takeoff. After the plane came to a stop, the number 2 engine, a powerful General Electric GE-90 turbofan, caught fire. Large flames engulfed the entire right wing of the plane while passengers sat mere feet away, recording the whole thing on their smartphones.

A few minutes later, according to witnesses, firefighters arrived on scene and began attacking the fire with foam and water, putting out the fire. The damage appeared quite extensive by looking at photographs taken by passenger Lee Bee Yee, who posted her account of the incident along with the pictures included in this article, on Facebook.

After the fire was extinguished, passengers were evacuated from the aircraft using air stairs on the left-hand side, and transported via bus to the terminal where they were later put on another flight to Milan.

An investigation is ongoing to determine the cause of the fire, although Singapore Airlines has been very tight-lipped about details, repeatedly telling those inquiring they would have to wait for the official report.

On a personal note, with a fire so large and seemingly dangerous, it's good to note that according to the airlines' statement, there were no injuries to passengers or crew. The crew and firefighters did an exemplary job maintaining the safety of the passengers.
